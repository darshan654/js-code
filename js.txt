js by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6NZfCO5SIk

html = content 
js=behavior

js was developed at netscape in 10 days alonge with a js engine(spidermonkey) which convert js to machine code for browers.


previously used for only on web site to make interactive pages thats why it was named a toy language 

not any more 

it can do a lot of thing now other then interactionüòÅ


js runs on a browser using a engine like v8 
.'. inspect web page and start writing js on console section
		or 
		use shortcut
			right side 
			ctrl+shift+j
	>>console.log("hello world")

we can also run js on stand alone system or server using node js 
node js is a runtime environment for js


intrestingly number + string = string
5+'5'
'55'
but number - string = number 
5-'5'
0

and play with dialoge boxes like alert prompt confirm

	window.alert("dfsdg")
	or
	alert




vscode

@as Intellij IDEA keybindiing ext is on use 

	‚Ä¢alt + insert insted of ctrl+n to create a new file
	‚Ä¢shift+alt+f to correct formate in vscode
	‚Ä¢shift+esc to open/close terminal 
	‚Ä¢alt+1 to open/close Explorer tab

1. in html file 
	type ! then tab/enter to generate a basic html 	boilerplate code.

1.1 add live server extension which will allow to run html from vscode
	right click on file in working area(explorer)-> open with live sserver
	ad=> no need to refersh the page
	shortcut alt+l alt+o

2.add script tag in head or body
	best practice is to add script tag at end of body 
	//as the engine will work after the html page is rendered 
	.'. good UE ->fast

	<script>
		console.log('hello');
		//interacting with console 
		//log=print
		//end with ; as java
	</script> 

	REFER index.html

3. sepration of cencerns
	html & JS in different files
	as done in first.js file

4.
	can directly run .js file on system using node 
		in cmd or powershell write 
		>>node first.js
		
		REFER first.js

5. variables / identifyers

		before ES6 var was used //have some complications
		.'. we use let and const now a days more 
		# camel Notation
			firstName üê™
		let lastName= 'xyz';
		console.log(lastName);

		const interestRate = 8.6
		//can't be change

		REFER literals type try.js


6. js is a dynamically type language
	means unlike in static t. l. a variable type can be changed during runtime

	REFER Dynamic_type_ln.js

7.			variable type
				/\
			   /  \

	  primetive    reference 

	REFER img (primetive_or_value _type.png)

	‚Ä¢boolean
	‚Ä¢undefined which is a value as well as a type
	‚Ä¢null is value and a obj type variable REFER(null_is_obj_type.png)
